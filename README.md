# YimTools

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/FluffyFox337/YimTools?display_name=release)](https://github.com/FluffyFox337/YimTools/releases/latest)

In this simple tool I have collected the products of respected developers and mods, primarily thanks to them you can use all the features built in here.
This script makes it easy to update and download Yim Menu and add-ons for comfortable use.

## Status
This program will be further developed and improved as I have free time. If you want to help, write to telegram:[ @Yelsoon ]

This is a simple bat script that I convert to exe before release.

## What can this program do?
* download and run the injector
* download the latest YimMenu
* download and install lua addons
* complete reset of all YimMenu settings and files
* opening YimMenu folders
* Internet availability check
* notification about the availability of an update for installed by YT addons and YimMenu

## What is planned to be added in the future?
* downloading and installing XML and JSON content like cars, maps, etc.
* downloading and installing custom ready-made settings for YimMenu from the author of YimTools (settings.json)
* full localization in English
* automatic update of all installed components (addons, YimMenu, etc.)
* 

### Latest release:
