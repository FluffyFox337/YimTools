# YimTools

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/FluffyFox337/YimTools?display_name=release)](https://github.com/FluffyFox337/YimTools/releases/latest)

In this simple tool I have collected the products of respected developers and mods, primarily thanks to them you can use all the features built in here.
This script makes it easy to update and download Yim Menu and add-ons for comfortable use.

## Status

This project is under constant development, but we do our best to keep things in a stable state. Players are encouraged to install from a release alongside their stable *osu!* client. This project will continue to evolve until we eventually reach the point where most users prefer it over the previous "osu!stable" release.

A few resources are available as starting points to getting involved and understanding the project:

- Detailed release changelogs are available on the [official osu! site](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog/lazer).
- You can learn more about our approach to [project management](https://github.com/ppy/osu/wiki/Project-management).
- Track our current efforts [towards improving the game](https://github.com/orgs/ppy/projects/7/views/6).
